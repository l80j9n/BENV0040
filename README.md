Coursework Aims (Learning Outcomes)
Upon successful completion of the coursework, the student should   be able   to:
•       Outline   the   main impacts   of   poor   indoor   air   quality    in   buildings,   in   terms   of   health,   comfort   and   wellbeing.
•       Evaluate data arising from the monitoring of selected pollutants indoor, and discuss      their   significance with respect to relevant   guidelines.
•       Suggest suitable air quality   remediation   strategies,   based   on   evaluation   of   building   performance.
Overall   Brief:This   coursework consists   in writing a   report evaluating the air   quality   of selected   rooms   within   a   case   study building. Air quality data arising from a previous monitoring campaign   is provided   -   students   are   not   expected   to   gather   additional   monitored   data,   other   than   downloading   the   outdoor   data   as   per   instructions provided.
The data is based on actual monitoring data of   the sort you are likely to encounter in your   professional   life.   It is from   monitoring carried out   in 2017 on   the fourth   floor of   Central   House   (UCL), when   loggers   were   placed   in   rooms   413,   416   and   418   (see   Fig   1   –   note   current   layout   now   differ).   Data   from   an   outdoor weather station   is also provided.

Resources   needed to complete this courseworkA spreadsheet is available on   Moodle, containing the   data   downloaded from   Eltek   monitors   that   have   been   running   in these   rooms for over a year   (Excel   spreadsheet   (CH      4      2017)).   As   you   will   observe   there      are      limitations    and       uncertainties    associated    with       monitoring,    and       missing    data      are       not   uncommon.   The   specification   for   some   of   the   equipment   used   in   the   monitoring   campaign   can   be   found on   Moodle.
In addition, you are to download data from the   London Air Quality   Network   (LAQN) for   (1)   London            Bloomsbury and   (2) Camden - Euston   Road –   Roadside monitoring   stations   for the   relevant   periods   (seehttps://www.londonair.org.uk/LondonAir/Dezfault.aspx). Go   to   the   bottom   of   the   page: Tools:               data downloads. Select the monitoring station, then   select   the   species   (PM2.5   etc.),   the   dates   of
interest then choose a   15 minutes   reading and   save   the   data   in   csv.   format.   This   can   later   be   added   to your copy of the spreadsheet   (CH      4    2017) for analysis.   Repeat for other pollutants monitored at      Central House 4th    floor and both external monitoring   locations.
Using the monitoring data from the   Excel spreadsheet   (CH      4    2017)   and   data   available from   the            London Air Quality   Network   (LAQN) for (1) London   Bloomsbury and   (2) Camden -   Euston   Road –      monitoring stations, consider outdoor levels of   PM2.5 and   NO2.   Discuss these   in   relation   to   indoor   parameters   (i.e.   PM2.5, CO2, temperature, humidity and   lux   levels), plus   meteorological   data   from   the weather station.
File(s) are provided on   Moodle with a   ready-made model   of the   building   in   DesignBuilder,   which   you   will use for exploring   some of the   recommended   interventions.
Further   Details
Please evaluate and   discuss:
1)      The performance of the   building and   its health   implication,   by making   reference to   existing   guidelines
2)      The   relationships between the external data and   IAQ;
3)      Any variations between the   rooms;
4)      The potential causes of the above;
5)      Propose any   interventions that may   代 写BENV0040 - Indoor Air Quality in Buildings – 2023-24SQL

approach will   be used to   identify some of these proposed   interventions.   Discuss the feasibility   of   these   interventionsIt   is   not   essential   that   you   visit   the   rooms   in   Central   House   where   monitoring   took   place   –   some   illustrative   pictures   are   provided   in   this   document.   If   you   do,   please   remember   these   are   working   offices, so try to be quiet and unobtrusive. Note, the layout of   floor 4 has somewhat changed since the   monitoring campaign.
Analyse, compare and contrast the data. Some examples,   (these are   possible   suggestions,   but   not         exclusive) include: variations between monitoring stations;   indoor/outdoor concentrations;   variations   in   room concentrations; comparisons with weather;   patterns   in ‘typical’ weeks; seasonal variations;         comparisons between pollutants;   pollutant concentrations’ frequency distributions.   Explain your
findings and their possible   causes.
Contrast your results with   relevant standards (e.g. WHO, Well and/or ASHRAE/CIBSE standards),         which you will need to   identify as   part of the assignment.   Suggest   any   possible   mitigation   strategies   based on your   results.
Details of the modelling will   be   provided during classes and   relevant   resources will   be available   on   the related   Moodle sections   (in the modelling week).   Please   note:
1)      You are expected to only model ONE week   (in   January,   see further details   in the   modelling   slides)
2)      Test at   least ONE of the three   remediation strategies which are   illustrated during   the   modelling   tutorials
THE FINAL   REPORT
You   should   use   material   from   the   course   and   other   modules   and   your   own   research   to   inform   your
report.    The   report should   include
1)      An   Introduction,   outlining   the   aims   of   the   report,   and   background   information   on   the   role   of   air   quality   in   health,   comfort and wellbeing   in   buildings   (supported   by   relevant   references   in the field   such as   research papers, studies and   reports),
2)      A   Methodology,   explaining   how   you   are   approaching   the   task,   for   example   the   rationale   for   the   analysis, any tools or statistical methods you might have used   and why.   Include   also   some   details   (e.g.   in   a   Table)   with   the   DesignBuilder   model   and   briefly   explain   how/why   you   approached   the   modelled scenarios.
3)      Results: a combination of diagrams, tables and text illustrating the key findings and discussing the   building performance from an air quality prospective.   Refer to suitable   guidelines when   relevant.
4)      Recommended   Interventions:   an   outline   of the   key   strategies   which   could   be   utilised   to   improve   the   building’s   air   quality   –   the   impact   of   some   of   these   interventions   (e.g.   open   windows   more   frequently)   can   be   tested   via   the   DesignBuilder   model.   The   potential   impact   of   recommended   strategies on   other aspects, such   as energy   consumption,   noise,   thermal   comfort etc.,   should   be   briefly discussed.


5)      Discussion, Conclusions and Recommendations for further research: you should state and discuss   any conclusions that you   draw from the   exercise.   Recommendations   for   further   research   are   also   expected, for example   improvement/changes to the type of data which was   collected   to   the   study.   Also discuss whether you can draw more generalizable   conclusions applicable   to   similar   buildings   to   Central   House.
What is included   in the Word count:
Please   refer toBSEER guidelines,   listed below for convenience too.   In addition   please note:
1)       For the purposes of this coursework, an abstract   is   NOT   required.
2)      Tables to illustrate analysis of findings are   NOT included in the word count, if used within   reasons.   Data Tables (with raw data), if required,   should   be   included   in an Appendix and   thus are   excluded   from the Word   Count.
General Coursework guidelines on word   count:
• Word counts include body text (from the title of the introduction to before the references section) and the body-text part of your references (name, year).


• Abstract, table of contents, any list of figures and tables, acknowledgements, references, appendices, footnotes, endnotes, diagrams and captions are excluded. Data tables - tables which collate raw data (for example, the tabulated responses to a questionnaire) should be included in an appendix and are therefore not counted.
• Students are advised that appendices and footnotes are to be used sparingly and must provide supporting information only. The content of these sections is not considered part of the main body of the assignment and will generally not contribute towards your grade. An electronic file must be submitted (Word format), with the word count clearly stated at the front.
